             <p>As I write this, I am thinking about how many people are in this world that have stress, anxiety, worry, and depression. It is a worsening pandemic that effects more people than any virus ever could. Mental health concerns are VERY very real and have an overall effect on someone that can truly be extremely detrimental to their health and others.
In 2020, almost 1/4 adults in America reported considering killing themselves at one point during the year. That statistic is truly alarming.</p>
              <br>
              <p>There are many reasons that this was higher than usual in 2020 (pandemic, unemployment, political turmoil, etc.) but the scary part is the trend happens to be growing. We cannot solely blame it on the Pandemic and the consequences that came with it. We can probably blame it on a lot of things, but most importantly we can blame it on Isolation, or as we now know it, "social distancing."</p>
               <br>
             <p>The truth is that we continue to be alone more and more as time goes by. We no longer hangout with friends or family, some of us avoided public places and interactions a long time before Covid started. We have lost respect for one another, but maybe most importantly, we lost respect for our God and for ourselves.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We all have to do a better job of following through, and a better job of finishing what we start. IF we all do that, the world would be a better place, filled with more Christ like people, and more Christians. So today, I challenge myself and I challenge you to find and fulfill your purpose with purpose, and finish the race strong, so that way we can be ready for more responsibilities that God will hand us!</p>
